The house is one of the four Sitsi \u00daunaaed residential buildings, in the middle of the inner quarter there is an apple orchard of nearly 5000 m2. In the courtyard there are 2 children's playgrounds, table tennis tables, a basketball court, benches, beautiful paths, which all together form a beautiful and friendly living environment.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHISTORY OF THE MANUFACTURING QUARTER<br \/>\nThe buildings of the Manufactory quarter include a number of different buildings protected as cultural monuments, which, together with the surrounding apple orchard and ancient park trees, form a unique environmentally valuable environment. The quarter's history dates back to 1898, when Emperor Nicholas II approved the charter of the Baltic Cotton Spinning and Knitting Factory.<br \/>\nIn 1900, the 234-meter-long, four-story main building designed by Rudolf Otto von Kn\u00fcpffer was completed in the area between Telliskopli road and the sea, to which a limestone wing building was added in 1908. Various extensions were gradually added during almost the entire history of the factory. Production reached its peak between the two world wars in 1928-1929, when the number of workers reached 2,000. In addition to cloth, various types of yarn and cotton wool were also produced. In 1940, the factory was nationalized by the Soviet authorities, and in 1941, the factory burned down in the whirlwind of war. In 1945, restoration work began, and the factory resumed production the following year. The production of raw cotton fabric and thread continued throughout the Soviet period. In the 1990s, after the restoration of Estonia's independence, the manufactory was acquired by Tolaram Grupp, production ended due to the pressure of the changed economic environment in 2006. Before closing the factory building, Tolaram Grupp started to prepare a detailed plan of the entire area in order to design the area into an up-to-date living and business quarter. The first fruit of this is the Sits apple garden quarter (with 269 apartments), which was completed in 2014-2019 in cooperation between Hepsor and Tolaram. In the same cooperation, the development of the rest of the factory area will continue<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLOCATION<br \/>\nThe location is only 3 kilometers from the heart of the city. It takes 6-10 minutes to reach the city center by car, 12-20 minutes by public transport, 10 minutes by bicycle, 30 minutes by foot. There is a public transport stop (200m), several grocery stores, a school and a kindergarten nearby.

This house features 2 unique attic apartments on the upper floors with unusual windows and high ceilings.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFINISHING<br \/>\nOnly first-class materials have been used in the interior finishing: natural oak parquet, Italian tiles, Hansgrohe sanitary ware. The price also includes kitchen furniture from Kraus K\u00f6\u00f6gid in the amount of 2000 euros.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nENERGY SAVING AND COMFORT<br \/>\nThe house is excellently insulated and has energy saving class A. A high-quality air-to-water heat pump has been installed to heat the apartments. The room temperature is set in each room using separate sensors. The apartments are heated by underfloor heating.
